# unime

*unime* is a unicode input assistant.


## Installation

Download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/kyungminlee/unime/releases).

## How to use

There are multiple ways to search for a unicode character:
- Type in the latex command of the character starting with a backslash `\`, such as `\alpha`, `\otimes`, or even subscripts and superscripts `\^2`, `\_x`.
- Type in the Unicode code of the character, starting with `\u` or `\U`, followed by the hex digits of the code. (e.g. `\u3b1`)
- Type in the HTML entity of the character, starting with `&#` and ending with `;`. (e.g. `&alpha;`, `&#945;`, `&#x3b1;`)
- Type in the name of the character. It is not case sensitive, and it does not have to be exact.

You can click an entry to copy the character to your clipboard.
